# k-means-tweets
This repository contains code for k-means clustering on several tweets data without using sklearn's kmeans library. k-means clustering is a unsupervised learning algorithm which divides the data into some clusters based on the similarity.

To run the k-means code, these are the steps need to be followed - 

The code has the following dependencies, which need to be installed before running this code:
a) Python. Install version greater than 3.5
d) Download the dataset in the data folder by given link below.
# Download dataset from the link https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Health+News+in+Twitter
e) Unzip the folder and copy any file name (on which k-means clustering need to be performed) in the code inside main function. 
f) Run the driver.py file for the results.
